# Water Level Indicator

A water level indicator circuit for household water tanks plays a crucial role in efficient water management. It helps prevent water wastage by indicating the current water level, allowing for timely action to turn off the pump when the tank is full or to turn it on when the tank is low. This automation not only saves water but also reduces energy consumption, providing convenience and reliability to homeowners. Designing a PCB for this circuit ensures a compact, organized, and reliable solution that can be easily integrated into a household system, making it user-friendly and effective for day-to-day use.
